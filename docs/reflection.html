            <p>The most significant challenge as someone new to web development was making sure the
                layout for the text and images was well organized. I often struggled to ensure the
                images on most pages were the right size and that they were neither too big nor too
                small. I also had some difficulty ensuring my resume page had a unique style that
                made it different from the other pages. Making sure my "Leaf by Niggle" Twine
                project works on computers other than mine is also challenging because I have to try
                and transfer my project file into my website folder and test it a few times to make
                sure it functions on other computers.</p>
            <p>I prefer making my website from HTML because I can instantly make it from scratch,
                and I can freely experiment with making colorful backgrounds by code and even use
                some of the fonts I have downloaded onto my laptop to make it visually appealing. I
                can also practice my XML coding skills with this software to increase my experience
                with using XML to code and program, all while perfecting my website at the same
                time. With WordPress, I do not code much and work with preset text options and image
                formatting options like gallery formatting options, and choose from a template
                despite how professional and modern they look.</p>
            <p>I did not face many challenges while making the WordPress version, but I faced many
                challenges while making the HTML version. These challenges include making sure the
                images and their captions are in the right size and are arranged in an organized
                manner and getting my resume page to look different from the other websites by
                trying to make sure everything is formatted professionally such as changing the font
                of the entire page's text to Times New Roman and changing the background color to a
                solid white color instead of a pastel-colored gradient. WordPress was easier to use
                than HTML because I had many ready-to-use features such as gallery formatting and
                header types that look consistent on all pages.</p>
            <p>Some necessary skills I learned were making a navigation bar for all my website's
                pages, making different style formats for certain text classes, and ensuring the
                images are consistent and well-organized. The navigation bar helps other people
                navigate from one page to another on my website. I can use different styles with
                class attributes so that they can appear to be different from other websites. I used
                this technique when developing the resume page so that the page can look as
                professional as an actual resume and that it does not look like the other pages. By
                keeping my images well formatted and organized by making sure they are in the proper
                size and organized side by side, my website would look well organized and not as
                cluttered.</p>
            <p>One skill that I want to improve on this website is making sure my files are easily
                accessible from other devices other than my laptop, including my Twine project.
                Whenever I work on my website and preview it on my web browser, the link for each
                page relates to my personal One Drive, which other users cannot access. By accessing
                the link from my GitHub page and embedding it into all linked items and text on both
                HTML and WordPress versions, I can access a link that is accessible for multiple
                users.</p>
