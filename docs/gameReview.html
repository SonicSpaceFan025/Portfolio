        <section class="reflection">
            <p>For this project, I decided to analyze the 1994 Sonic the Hedgehog title "Sonic &
                Knuckles" by playing the game on an online SEGA Genesis emulator on the emulation
                website PlayClassic.games and analyzing what goes on in the game as I played. I
                wanted to play "Sonic & Knuckles" because I am a big Sonic the Hedgehog fan, and I
                wanted to find a popular classic game in the franchise that I have not tried
                out.</p>

                <figcaption class="corpus">Upon loading the game, I immediately found a character
                    select on the bottom of the screen after the game's logo appeared. This feature
                    allows me to play as either Sonic the Hedgehog or Knuckles the
                    Echidna.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">First, I decided to play the game as Sonic the Hedgehog.
                    Upon selecting him, I was immediately taken to the start of Act 1 of the game's
                    first world, Mushroom Hill Zone. There, I was presented with a vibrant jungle
                    landscape with some funky music that played in the background. This stage is a
                    basic introduction to what gameplay is like in the game as a whole; it involves
                    collecting rings to add score and protect your health, jumping on robotic
                    enemies, and defeating robotic bosses.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">Partway into Act 1, I found a hidden passage that had a
                    large golden ring inside it. Upon touching it, I was immediately transported
                    into a special stage where I am tasked to run around a globular environment and
                    collect blue spheres. When collecting enough blue spheres, they turn into red
                    spheres, and when I touch enough blue spheres in a single group, all the spheres
                    turn into rings for me to collect. Touching red spheres makes me immediately
                    lose the stage, and white ones with red stars work like bumpers that push me
                    back.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">After accidentally touching one of the red spheres, the
                    special stage ended and I found this results screen that showed me the score
                    based on how many rings I collected I also saw a perfect score criteria, which I
                    did not achieve because I failed. I was expecting my first run to not be perfect
                    because I do not have any experience with this particular title.</figcaption>

        <section class="reflection">
            <p>After the special stage ended, I was taken back to the place in Mushroom Hill Zone
                where I initially found the ring that enabled me to enter the special stage. The
                ring is not there this time, which means the special stage appears once.</p>

                <figcaption class="corpus">After running through the stage a little more, I
                    encountered the first boss of the game, which is a flying robot wielding a giant
                    axe. This boss uses its axe to chop wood from wooden columns, and for each
                    swing, its sends a long from the column flying toward me. When the boss is
                    almost finished cutting down the column, its struggles to get its axe out of the
                    column, giving me the opportunity to attack. After a few hits, the boss flies
                    off, giving me the opportunity to chase it down, and the process repeats. After
                    jumping on the boss a few more times, the boss exploded, signaling the end of
                    the battle. Energetic music played throughout the battle, pumping me up to fight
                    the boss.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">After defeating the boss, a spinning sign depicting Sonic
                    drops down on the ground while twinkling noises played, and I saw the results
                    for my performance on this stage. I get bonus points based on how long it took
                    me to complete the stage and how many rings I collected. When the results
                    appeared, a short musical piece that sounded like a fanfare played, signifying
                    victory.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">Upon completing the first stage, I found this cutscene of
                    Knuckles the Echidna pulling a lever that blows a strong gust below Sonic,
                    carrying him upward into the next act of Mushroom Hill Zone. This cutscene shows
                    how Knuckles interacts with Sonic in this game. Here, he is an obstacle to
                    Sonic.</figcaption>

                    there is a little funkier version of the first act's music despite the slightly

                    are on a ramp. I tried to figure out how I could break them to progress, but no
                    matter how hard I tried to get up the ramp to try and break those blocks or spin
                    dash toward them, I ended up getting stuck because I cannot figure out how I can

            <p>After getting stuck on Mushroom Hill Zone Act 2 as Sonic, I decided to begin Knuckles
                the Echidna's campaign in the game. Knuckles's campaign is played like Sonic's
                campaign, but with some new controls such as gliding after jumping, climbing on
                walls, and breaking through rocks while running.</p>

        <section class="reflection">
            <p>Unlike Sonic's campaign, there are some differences in the story, primarily cutscene
                placement and what the cutscenes depict, and how bosses interact with Knuckles.</p>

                <figcaption class="corpus">Upon starting Knuckles's campaign, I saw a cutscene
                    involving Knuckles the Echidna relaxing in Mushroom Hill Zone while surrounded
                    by small animals like Cuckies (chickens) and Rickies (squirrels) when a bomb
                    drops down on the ground, scaring the animals away. An Egg-Robo then appears,
                    and Knuckles shakes his fist at it. The first act of Mushroom Hill Zone then
                    begins immediately following the cutscene.</figcaption>

                    alt="screenshot from a video game" class="corpus" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">Playing through Mushroom Hill Zone Act 1 is almost the
                    same as Sonic except with Knuckles's distinctive controls that make it easier
                    for me to progress through the stage. When I encountered the axe-wielding robot
                    near the end, I initially thought it would attack the same way as when
                    confronting it as Sonic. As I defeated the boss, I noticed some differences in
                    how the boss attacks Knuckles. An example is the robot throwing its head at
                    Knuckles instead of getting the axe stuck on the stump of the wooden column.
                    This makes it a little harder for me to determine when I should attack the
                    robot. After defeating it, I immediately enter Act 2 of Mushroom Hill Zone
                    instead of seeing a cutscene between the two acts.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </section>
        <section class="reflection">
            <p>Progressing through Act 2 as Knuckles is easier than as Sonic because I can easily
                crash through rock walls (especially where I got stuck when playing as Sonic!) and
                glide through the air. This feature makes me believe it would be easier for me to
                play the game as Knuckles because of these benefits.</p>

                    alt="screenshot from a video game" style="width:60%" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">Near the end of Act 2, I encountered the campaign's
                    second boss, which is an Egg-Robo piloting a blue aircraft. During this battle,
                    I have to jump through beams of spiked balls for me to reach the boss and attack
                    it by jumping on it. This battle is a little more difficult than the first
                    because the beams go by fast and at different heights, and the battle is on
                    auto-scroll, making me constantly have to move without getting hit. I keep
                    getting hit by the spike balls, making me lose my rings and lose lives. It is
                    frustrating to have to keep trying to time my jumps perfectly to attack. After
                    losing my last life, I am given a "Game Over" message on-screen, and I am taken
                    back to the game's title screen. When selecting Knuckles's campaign again, I had
                    to begin all the way back from the beginning instead of continuing where I left
                    off, which I find infuriating.</figcaption>

        <h2 class="index">Overall Analysis</h2>
        <section class="reflection">
            <p>The features that help me create an illusion of exploring a world include paths for
                me to travel on and vibrant scenery like a forest-like atmosphere with plenty of
                mushrooms for Mushroom Hill Zone. Despite being 16-bit, the graphics effectively
                illustrate fantastical landscapes with cartoony-looking characters that make the
                game light-hearted.</p>
            <p>The fantastical settings are vibrant and mostly well-made which makes it easy for me
                to navigate. Some parts of the game are hard to impossible for me to progress no
                matter what I do to solve the problem. The two acts I saw are distinguished by
                different changes in color in both the foreground and background, along with changes
                in background music that make them different from each other.</p>
            <p>This game allows me to choose between two characters: Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles
                the Echidna. Sonic the Hedgehog is the main protagonist, and his controls involve
                running, jumping, and spin-dashing through stages. Knuckles the Echidna is one of
                Sonic’s obstacles in the game, and when playing as Knuckles, his controls are almost
                the same as Sonic’s. What makes Knuckles different from Sonic is that Knuckles can
                glide after jumping, climb on walls, and even smash through rocks while running.</p>
            <p>The interactions I have with NPCs mainly involve attacking them if they are robotic
                enemies that hinder my progress. Some NPCs are small animals that are trapped inside
                the robots that I must rescue by jumping on the robots.</p>
            <p>This game involves Sonic the Hedgehog or Knuckles the Echidna saving their world from
                the evil Dr. Eggman. I get stuck in stages where I cannot find a way to progress
                even if I try, such as a very tall ramp with a blocked corridor in it. I make
                progress by completing acts and defeating bosses in the game. In this game, I
                collect rings to score points and protect my health, jump on springs, perform
                acrobatic stunts on bars, and jump on robots to rescue small animals trapped inside
                them. In the special stage, I run through blue spheres to turn them into rings for
                me to collect.</p>
            <p>The music in the Mushroom Hill Zone stages sounds funky, adding to the 90s vibe of
                the game. One act sounds moderately fast and funky, while the other act sounds a
                little faster and funkier, making it different. In the special stage, the music
                sounds upbeat and joyful, adding to the excitement of earning more points in the
                special stage. In the boss battles, the music sounds energetic, pumping me up for
                the battle ahead. The sound effects in the game sound cartoony, such as slide
                whistle-like noises when jumping, sparkly noises when collecting or dropping rings,
                and whirring noises when spin-dashing.</p>
            <p>The game does not comment on itself in a “meta” way. It also does not show any
                cultural issues from our world that I saw reflected in this game.</p>
            <p>Some improvements that this game could include are adding save points for me to
                progress from where I left off instead of starting all the way back from the
                beginning when losing all lives and adding hints on how I can progress through the
                stages if I get stuck.</p>
