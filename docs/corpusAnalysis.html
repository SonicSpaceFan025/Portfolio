        <section class="reflection">
            <p>For this project, I used AntConc and Voyant to analyze text patterns in a television
                corpus and a movies corpus, both of which examine dialects used in casual speech in
                the two media in the mid-twentieth century. When using these two programs, at first,
                I noticed that the two files use almost the exact words, but when I dig deeper into
                each file, I found that there are different contextual meanings for many words and
                phrases.</p>

        <h2 class="index">Voyant</h2>

                <img src="images/wordCloud.png" class="corpus"
                    alt="An illustration of words forming a cloud shape" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">First, I used Voyant to provide visual insights about
                    which words and phrases appear the most. Upon loading the two files into Voyant,
                    I immediately noticed that the word cloud displayed very common words such as
                    "n't," "know," "just," and "right," but as I expanded the word cloud to get more
                    words in it, I saw that the more interesting words appeared in the cloud as
                    smaller text, as it is not used as frequently as the aforementioned words. I
                    then looked at each file's word cloud separately, and I found that each cloud
                    uses almost the exact words the most, with some slight differences in how often
                    certain words appear in one file than in the other.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="corpus">As I explored other features of Voyant, I noticed that
                    the program even analyzes how frequent a word exclusively appears in one
                    document and not the other, such as "Lovejoy" and "steed" in the TV file, and
                    "froggy" and "Thorndyke" in the movie file. I even noticed that the movie file
                    has a higher vocabulary desity than the TV file; the movie file has a vocabulary
                    density of 0.023, while the TV file's vocabulary density is 0.022, which is
                    slightly lower than the movie file's vocabulary density.</figcaption>

        <h2 class="index">AntConc</h2>
        <section class="reflection">
            <p>After analyzing the textual differences in Voyant, I used another corpus analysis
                program, AntConc, to compare how files are analyzed there in contrast with Voyant.
                Unlike Voyant, AntConc does not provide much visual insight in text analysis, and it
                mainly focuses on words and phrases.</p>

        <h3 class="index">KWIC (Keyword in Context)</h3>
        <section class="photoGallery">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sorts_5.png" class="corpus" alt="Textual information of a phrase" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">In this section, I inputted the phrase "all sorts of" to
                    see different contexts of that phrase. When I set the context size to 5, I
                    noticed simple results such as "all sorts of questions about," "all sorts of
                    things ...," and "all sorts of stuff ..." The results' vague text made me not
                    understand much about what the phrases are supposed to explain.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sorts_10.png" class="corpus"
                    alt="An expanded version of the textual information of the same phrase" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">After changing the context size to 10 using the same
                    phrase, I noticed the same phrases have deeper context, and that they reveal
                    more information about different ideas, such as an arts foundation promoting
                    Bolivian culture, Agent Morgan being involved in smuggling, and a counselor
                    teaching people to cope with addiction and divorce. Based on the results, I
                    found that the TV file primarily shows information about different people, and
                    the movie file shows details about not only people, but also different events.
                    With this feature, I get to understand more of what certain words or phrases
                    reveal about different characters or situations within a given
                    passage.</figcaption>

        <h3 class="index">Clusters</h3>
        <section class="reflection">
            <p>Another feature of AntConc I used to learn more about the two passages is the cluster
                feature, which lets me input a word or a phrase and adjust the size of the cluster
                (how many words in a phrase with the inputted word or phrase) and the minimum number
                of times that phrase appears.</p>

                    alt="A table illustrating the frequency of certain phrases" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">In this feature, I wanted to see how many phrases uses
                    the word "years," as it appeared very frequently in both files, as well as how
                    many times these phrases appear. Here, I set the minimum frequency number to 2
                    and set the cluster size to 4. The resulting phrases showed little to no
                    context, as many of them had vague meanings, such as "years ago I was," "years
                    old and I," "years of his life," and "years ago we were."</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/years_3-6.png" class="corpus"
                    alt="A shortened table illustrating the frequency the same phrase" />
                <figcaption class="corpus">After increasing the minimum frequency number to 3 and
                    the cluster size to 6, I found very few phrases, but this time, they showed
                    somewhat more context. One phrase reveals how much time ago something happened
                    ("years ago I do nt"), and another shows how much time passed ("years passed and
                    my brother and"). Based on this observation, I learned that like with the KWIC
                    feature, changing the size and frequency in the clusters feature lets me find
                    deeper context within certain words and phrases, and the larger the cluster
                    size, the more context the phrase reveals.</figcaption>

        <h2 class="index">Conclusion</h2>
        <section class="reflection">
            <p>Based on my findings from this experience, I learned that Voyant and AntConc can be
                used for text analysis in two distinct areas. Voyant is used to visually illustrate
                how often certain words and phrases appear and the contextual relationships between
                them, and AntConc is used to show analyze text frequency and context by using tables
                changing sizes of different phrases. Both programs are useful in helping me find
                useful information about different passages and lets me compare them.</p>
